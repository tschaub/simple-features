# Simple Features

A simple feature model for working with geospatial data in JavaScript.

Note that this doesn't strictly follow the [OGC Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) spec(s).  Instead, see [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) for inspiration.

Until there are more docs here, see the [tests](./test/lib/index.spec.js) for more detail.
